Episode  Ⅱ\n
(('tag:large:ATTACK OF THE RAKE'))
\n\n
It is a patient time to the PicoRuby. Although the PRK Firmware has been released and it brought the First Prize of the Fukuoka Ruby Award and a Final nomination to the Ruby Prize, problems are piling up such as a lack of syntax rules and an inconsistent build system with mruby.
\n
\n
Hasumikin, an apprentice to a Rubyist, is strugglingly writing the compiler to compile mrblib of mruby under the coaching of Master MATZ to restore freedom to the micon galaxy....

  * Struct "mrb_context" now bothers me
    * It holds information like local variables so to IRB work
    * Hard to handle due to intricate dependency among mrb_state, mrb_context and mrb_irep
    * PicoRuby compiler doesn't want to include mruby's header files

    * Hard to handle due to intricate dependency among mrb_state, mrb_context and mrb_irep
    * PicoRuby compiler doesn't want to include mruby's header files
  * Possible solutions:\n
    1. Fixing mruby\n
    2. Fixing PicoRuby compiler to make an IREP that can be cast into mrb_irep
